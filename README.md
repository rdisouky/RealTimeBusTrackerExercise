# RealTimeBusTrackerExercise
 Course Project: This exercise shows a matker moving on a map to highlight the number and location of stops between two locations (MIT & Harvard). It is a cool representation of a dynamic marker once you hit the button. 
 
How to Run: 
- Clone this repository
- Open index.html file
- Enjoy!

Roadmap of future improvements: I am hoping to make the marker stay and change color before moving to the next stop as opposed to hitting a stop and disappearing when it hits the next stop. This will leave an audit trail of the bus route after the marker goes through all the stops.
